* To **upgrade** from an older version, see [Upgrade from API Gateway 7.5.x or 7.6.x](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_extcass/).
* For more details on supported platforms for software installation, see [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).
* For a summary of the system requirements for a Docker deployment, see [Set up Docker environment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_scripts_prereqs/).

### Update a container deployment

Any custom `.fed` files deployed to a container must be upgraded using [upgradeconfig](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_analytics#upgradeconfig-options) or [projupgrade](/docs/apim_reference/devopstools_ref#projupgrade-command-options). They must be upgraded the same way, regardless of whether they are API Manager enabled or not. The `.fed` files contain the updates for the API Manager configuration and can be used to build containers.

## New features and enhancements

### Antivirus filters
<!-- Brian Lynch to review this section, whether it's needed -->
In the [January 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200130_apimgr_relnotes/) update, we announced the deprecation of all the Antivirus filters in API Gateway. This is a reminder that in August 2021 we will remove the Antivirus filters from API Gateway. So, we recommend you to use the API Gateway's ICAP capability, which allows the gateway to integrate with ICAP capable external virus scanners.

### Scripting filter whiteboard attributes not preloaded for Jython scripts

The Scripting filter now uses a Jython 2.7 scripting environment (previously, Jython 2.5) to execute Jython scripts. As a result of this version change, the whiteboard attributes, such as `http.request.uri` and `http.request.verb`, are no longer preloaded for use by Jython scripts. However, you can run a Jython script to load these attributes before they are accessed as follows:

```
from com.vordel.trace import Trace

def invoke(msg):
    msg.forceGenerateAttributes()
    Trace.info("This trace statement was generated in script filter!  [" + str(msg.get("http.request.verb")) + "] [" + str(msg.get("http.request.uri")) + "]")
    return True
```

### When an API Gateway instance is started, Xerces SAXParserImpl writes warnings to the error console

At API Gateway instance startup, the following warnings are logged to the error console, as opposed to the trace log:

```
Warning: org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserImpl$JAXPSAXParser: Property 'http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/property/accessExternalDTD' is not recognized.
Warning: org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserImpl$JAXPSAXParser: Property 'http://www.oracle.com/xml/jaxp/properties/entityExpansionLimit' is not recognized.
```

These new properties were added in JAXP 1.5 specification, which is supported by the embedded implementation in the JRE but not supported yet in Xerces-J Apache implementation. These are harmless warning messages, which are written to the error console instead of throwing an exception if a property is not supported by the Apache Xerces-J implementation.

### No VAPI matched request after upgrade from 7.5.3 SP12 using inbound security policy

If the following errors are present in the API Gateway traces when the instance is started, then there is a duplicate remote host configuration in API Gateway and API Manager configurations.

Duplicate remote host error:

```
ERROR 11/Mar/2021:11:10:27.207 [6dc4:000000000000000000000000] Failed to configure module:

Failure to configure circuit for VAPI error:

 at com.vordel.apiportal.runtime.AuthenticationPolicySecurityDevice.configure(AuthenticationPolicySecurityDevice.java:73)
```

To circumvent this problem, edit the API Gateway server configuration using Policy Studio and remove the duplicate remote host definition from **Environment Configuration > Listeners**, then deploy the updated configuration back to the server or servers in a group.
